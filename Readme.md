# About
This tool transforms wav files into spectrograms. Either as a PNG or as a json for further use in tensorflow.

# How to use:
Rename `.env.example`, change the default config to your demands and put the audio files to convert into the `AUDIO_IN` folder.

# Misc 
Let me know if you need this as an NPM package. I can convert it and make the process envs to an options object.
